# Customtkinter
# 170 ms to init
# 188 ms to run and then instantly close without widgets.
# 50ms for importing the library

# 50ms total overhead added from 1 widget.
# 70ms total overhead added from 2 widgets.
# 520ms total overhead added from 100 widgets.
# 3288ms total overhead added from 1000 widgets.

# Additionally, its actually 20ms to actually render each widget, Which is done after the window is shown.
# Max widget count before the user actually has to wait for it to render at startup: 10.
# It doesn't render again if no changes are needed.
# Resizing is a little jittery. Cant profile but I can notice it.
# Ram usage: 40mb without widgets. 47mb with 100 widgets.

# Trilent
# 0.2 ms to init
# 5 ms to run and then instantly close without widgets.
# 80ms for importing the library (Qt is huge)

# 1ms total overhead added from 1 widget.
# 2ms total overhead added from 2 widgets.
# 9ms total overhead added from 100 widgets.
# 75ms total overhead added from 1000 widgets

# Max widget count before the user actually has to wait for it to render at startup: 4000.
# Doesn't render again if no changes needed too.
# Resizing is insanely smooth.
# Ram usage: 35mb without widgets. 41mb with 100 widgets.

# Note that ram usage for both customtkinter and trilent is likely that high due to python being an interpreted language
